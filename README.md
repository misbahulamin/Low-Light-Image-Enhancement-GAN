# Low-Light Image Enhancement using GANs

A deep learning project for enhancing low-light images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This repository provides a complete pipeline for low-light image enhancement, leveraging state-of-the-art GAN architectures to improve visibility in dark or poorly-lit images.

## Features

- **Low-Light Image Enhancement**: Enhances visibility in dark images using GAN-based models.
- **Dataset**: Utilizes the LOL (Low-Light) dataset for training and evaluation.
- **Noise Handling**: Includes support for adding Gaussian, Salt-and-Pepper, Poisson, and Speckle noise.
- **Complete Pipeline**: Covers data preprocessing, model architecture, training, and evaluation.

## Dataset

This project uses the [LOL Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/soumikrakshit/lol-dataset/data) for training and validation. You can download the dataset from Kaggle.

Ensure the dataset is structured as follows:


### Explanation:
- **Repository Title**: Describes the project's objective of enhancing low-light images using GANs.
- **Features Section**: Outlines the capabilities of the project (e.g., image enhancement, noise handling, etc.).
- **Dataset Section**: Explains the structure of the LOL dataset and provides the link to download it.
- **Installation Section**: Instructions on how to clone the repo, install dependencies, and set up the dataset.
- **Usage Section**: Provides instructions for training the model, enhancing images, and visualizing the model architecture.
- **Results Section**: Example of the before-and-after enhancement comparison (you can replace the sample image paths with actual ones).
- **Contributing Section**: Encourages contributions from other developers.
- **License Section**: Specifies that the project is licensed under the MIT License.

### Next Steps:
1. Replace `<your-username>` with your actual GitHub username in the repository URL.
2. Modify the image paths in the **Before and After Enhancement** section once you have the images to showcase.
3. Add any additional information specific to your project if needed.

You can now save this markdown content as `README.md` in your GitHub repository. Let me know if you need any further help!
